# Multilingual-Text-Translator
This project is a simple yet effective language translator application built using Python's Tkinter for the GUI, Google Translate API for translation, and a list of languages provided by Google Translate. Users can input text in one language and select a destination language from a dropdown menu to translate the text into. The translated text is displayed in a separate output box. The application allows for easy translation between a wide range of languages, making it useful for various language translation needs. Feel free to contribute to this project and enhance its features!
